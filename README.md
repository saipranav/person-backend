# Microservices Playground

#### I am trying to learn and to kick start new technologies with a very basic use case of sending invite to people for a session.
##### This playground is also for experimenting architectural level technologies like docker, kubernetes, consul etc
---
##### This is the person backend which has follwing technologies/frameworks.

  - Node JS
  - Loopback
  - Gulp
  - Mocha
  - Supertest

Person backend provides all the email id of an organisation who can be invited to a session.

This is built on top of standard loopback project [loopback].
> NOTE: I am still learning and using this to get the best pratices with loads of experiments even like with camelCase or snake_case for readablilty. So, it may not be the best defacto thing to start if you are learning from this repo.
